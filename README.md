# SMU_ChatBot
ChatBot Created For The SMU 2022 Hackathon

Campaigns surrounding employment rights are common. But this commonality is futile — many youths are still oblivious to the same. We proffer two reasons for this: 
(1) these campaigns do not fully reach youths; and 
(2) if those campaigns somehow reach youths, they have little impact in the long run. 

Our solution hinges on a multi-tiered interactive chatbot called IKE (abbreviation for: Imparting Knowledge on Employment). The first tier encapsulates a question and answer portion. As the name suggests, the user will ask a question from the provided question bank and the bot will give the corresponding answer. The second tier is an interactive component, i.e., the user will be given the option to view a poster or video that explains the employment right that is expounded by the question. The third tier is an optional quiz: this serves as a medium to test users on their knowledge — if they so wish to do so, that is.

At present, IKE is easily scalable: it can be deployed to any website or app and complement already available e-services. In our view, this allows IKE to reach youths easily. A feedback option is also encoded to ensure that IKE is amended and remains viable in the future. 

But it does more than just a chatbot with a fixed set of questions — it has long term potential too. In future renditions, after proper scaling is endeavoured, IKE will utilise machine learning to allow user to ask any questions about employment instead of the limited range presently available. This would ensure sustainability in the long-run, with users able to visit the chatbot to ask new questions — and perhaps refresh their knowledge on previous asked topics. Ergo, we humbly aver that IKE will be effective in spreading employment rights to lower wages youths as it tackles the concerns brought about by previous solutions targeted at the same (i.e., campaigns).
